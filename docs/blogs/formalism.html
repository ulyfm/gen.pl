<h1>Applications of Russian Formalism in CG Art</h1>
<h3>15-6-2017</h3>
<p>The Russian Formalists were a group of literary critics in Russian who tried to create a system to analyze works of literature on a scientific basis. They tried to understand the use of traditional motifs (especially those that appear in multiple separate cultures). Although their project never got very far, in part due to the Russian Revolution and Trotsky's alternative critical framework, this kind of approach potentially has applications in computer-generated art.
